I am a third-year CS Ph.D. student in the School of Computational Science and Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology. My advisor is [Prof. Yunan Luo](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~yunan/).

I am broadly interested in machine learning (ML) and computational biology. I am devoted to developing novel machine learning tools to aid biological research, and I am particularly interested in utilizing machine learning tools to address complex protein-related challenges. My primary research focuses include:
- Machine learning-guided protein engineering
- Biological network alignment
