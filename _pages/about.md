I am a CS Ph.D. student in the [School of Computational Science and Engineering](https://cse.gatech.edu/), [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://gatech.edu/), advised by [Prof. Yunan Luo](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~yunan/). Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/).

I am broadly interested in machine learning (ML) and computational biology. I am devoted to developing novel machine learning tools to aid biological research, and I am particularly interested in utilizing machine learning tools to address complex protein-related challenges. My primary research focuses include:
- Machine learning-guided protein engineering
- Biological network alignment
